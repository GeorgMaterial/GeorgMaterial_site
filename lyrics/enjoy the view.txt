do you ever feel like
its all been made for you
i can’t imagine needing to impress
any one but you
are you the somebody 
who’ll walk the long way with me 
i dont know where we’re going 
but i like walking unknown streets 

i’ll stare at your cheeks for a while
and as you enjoy the view
i will too

when shadows shift from black to blue
and oxygen burns my throat 
cut to me laying in my room
yearning to hold you dont u choke

how would your hips feel in my hands 
wanna get too close & still before we kiss
nothing here but the sound of my fan 
tangled in the white noise
& tension of this 

are you the somebody
who’ll walk the long way with me 
i dont know where we’re going
but i like wandering unknown streets

i’ll stare at your cheeks for a while
while you enjoy the view 
i will too
