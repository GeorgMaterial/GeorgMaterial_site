my eyes are carrying the moon
the whole world asleep
in a sea of blacky blue
i’ll have a coffee or two
the lights are softer at four am
than when i’m with you

my legs are cold but i’ll keep my fan on
summers on its way with heat unheard of
that heat is loud, but the night is silent
in its wisdom
i’ll probably fall asleep when the sun comes up

but about you
i feel like i have something to say
but my tongue wont form it
just enjoy yourself anyway
i dont know if, i’ll
make it to tomorrow day

sometimes silence is my best friend
but tonight i hear the whispers 
and i want it to end
cant remember the last book i read
dont let my brain turn to mush
oh you’re my only friend 

but about you
i feel like i have something to say
but my tongue wont form it
just enjoy yourself anyway
i dont know if, i’ll
make it to tomorrow day

i give you love, and in return i’m confused
how many times do i have to say
i wish i never kissed you

history has been my teacher 
but i havent been listening

i wish i wasn’t writing this song
but i wish there wasn’t anything wrong
with us
