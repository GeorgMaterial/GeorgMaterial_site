i cant remember what it felt like now
but when i feel it i know
lying in my bed for days 
constantly feeling like i’ll throw
up and i cant eat

wish i had the self control to stay offline
people keen retweeting things
that trigger me i hate my timeline
muted generic words like death and kill myself
just keep trying to rest 

i cant imagine how much i bore my friends
oh no i cant see you i have shaking hands 
coffee makes me sick
but i’ll drink it anyway
i dont even like how it tastes
i’m a dumbass by the way

what even is there to say 
the feeling stayed but it changed
i know that i dont feel the same 
and i dont know why
but i’m glad that im alive
