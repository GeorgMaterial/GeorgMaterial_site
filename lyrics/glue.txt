loneliness comes quick & thick at night
punctures my lungs 
and holds me til im sick with it 
i just wanna be behind your eyes
be the light
i wanna be what makes your face light up
but you wont even look at me 

oooo but i like you
please dont leave me as number two
i know our moments have been too few
but oooo i like you
please dont leave me as number two
let me wrap up your heart and stick it to mine with glue 

oh i just wish you’d let me kiss you between the eyes
hold my hand feel my love til you’re sick with it
someone once told me i’m the first girlfriend type
but let me be your first, last, only lady
let me keep you up at night

chorus

has anyone told you
you’re the prettiest girl in the world
i’m gonna tell you
i want us to be together

oh i think we are meant to be 
like arts & crafts get stuck with me
compare our hands shape i want to see
how our hands fit together
be with me 

chorus 

stick it to mine with glue

let me wrap up your heart
& stick it to mine with glue
