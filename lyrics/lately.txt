lately i’ve been remembering
the way you held me 
in my dark room
lately i’ve been remembering 
the way your face felt
pressed against mine

and i dont miss you
i just miss how that felt
i couldnt miss you
you werent really anything else to me

lately i’ve been reading romance novels
and wondering if 
if i’ll ever find someone so consuming
lately i’ve been considering
coming out to my family
but they wouldnt see me like you did

chorus

lately i’ve been missing
long walks on the beach
long drives where you couldnt stop looking at me 
lately i’ve been missing 
phone calls for hours
this feeling crushing me

and i dont miss you
i just really miss how that felt
and i might miss you
if you didnt turn out like everyone else
no i couldnt miss you 
i just miss the rush when you wanted 
to hold my hand
maybe i miss you
maybe i do
maybe i miss you
maybe i do

lately i’ve been missing you
