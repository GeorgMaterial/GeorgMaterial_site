sometimes my fingertips arent good enough 
textures feel better when i brush em against my lips
and i prefer my tea in the summer
in air conned rooms where the heat always escapes me
i think i see the world a little differently
train tracks & jet packs are the soundtrack of my dreams
i’m a little too affected by what i see on tv 
my friends hang on my wall to remind me 
that i 
am a subject of humanity
a chapter of reality
and i’m still tryna wrap my head around it 

i’ve told my friends i dont think i’ll make it to 30
i’m not suicidal i just dont think it exists
i have a problem where if i cant imagine it i wont do it
and sorry mum but i cant imagine having kids
oh i think i see things differently 
the best thing about that kiss was the look on his face
and the best wine i’ve ever had was a four dollar bottle of gossips
but i play board games with my friends and they remind me that i
am subject to them loving me
am a chapter in our legacy
and i’m still tryna wrap my head around it 

i dont know why people live 
and at this point i’m too scared to ask
too many nights thinking about death
i hope this feeling doesnt last
i dont know why people live 
and at this point i’m too scared to ask
too many nights staring at the ceiling 
i hope this feeling doesnt last
