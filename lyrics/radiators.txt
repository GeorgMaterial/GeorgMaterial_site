i want to know the feeling
of never being close enough
the softest cheeks could sleep on mine 
and our fingers dance intertwined
i’d know your mothers name 
and hopefully she’d like mine
our proximity cant be defined

but rain keeps falling
and my lungs feel empty
and no ones here

i’d say
lets get stuck in a broken down elevator
15 floors up with no one around to save us
i would stay relaxed for hours 
just getting to know your mind
i’d want to give you all my time

rain keeps falling
and my lungs feel empty
and no ones here
radiators don't do shit anymore 
i need skin on skin to keep me warm

i need someone to not keep their hands off me
slip into my cracks
keep me from shuddering
and love definitely tastes as sweet
as the romantic made it seem
when the world ends baby
i want you to stay with me
yeah when the world ends baby
i want you to stay with me

because rain keeps falling 
and my lungs feel empty
and no ones here
radiators don't do shit anymore 
i need skin on skin to keep me warm

so when the world ends baby
i want you to stay with me
love definitely tastes as sweet
as the romantic made it seem
so when the world ends baby 
i want you to stay with me
