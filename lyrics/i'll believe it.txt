What if we run out of things to say
Cause I’ve tied my tongue to the back of your face
I guess it wouldn’t be too bad to cut it off
Cause if I can’t talk to you
I’d rather not talk at all
Why’d you keep calling
In the middle of the day
When all I talk about is how I’m scared of change
Well when you get to the crux of it
I don’t get why you say I’m your favourite phone call

But I’ll believe it when I see it
I’ll believe it when I see it

Maybe God is racist to aliens
And we haven’t seen any because She hates them
I spend too much time pondering the sky
And you never try to tie me back down
What if we run out of things to do
Maybe one day we’ll grow tired of my room
But I tell you
Even when you’re against yourself
My hands fit your hands perfectly

I’ll believe it when I see it
I’ll believe it when I see it

Maybe I’m just sitting here waiting for you
To change your mind
Because to be alive is to be awake
And these days darling I am just so tired
Good dreams are the ones that sting
And every year is an abstract thing
And your words seem to light the dim

I’ll believe it when I see it 
I’ll believe it when I see it
I’ll believe it when I see it
I’ll believe it when I see it 
I’ll believe it when I see it
I’ll believe it when I see it
