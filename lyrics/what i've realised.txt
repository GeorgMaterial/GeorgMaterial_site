i think im in love with you
no not the friendship kind
and its frustrating
theres always a them and 
never a me on your mind 
cant say im interested in liberation
but validation might be nice 
not sure if you know
but you turn the cogs behind my eyes

one day i’m going to explode and tell you everything 
i’ll drive to your road leave my heart with the mail and go home

although we never mention it
dont think i’ve forgotten
what happened with us years ago
spilled my guts in the front seat at 4am
why are all my love songs about you

one day i’m going to explode and tell you everything 
i’ll drive to your road leave my heart with the mail and go home
